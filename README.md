Welcome to the Github of the **Team Apple**

## 🕵️ Project description
Real or Not? NLP with Disaster Tweets: In this project, you are challenged to build a Machine Learning model that can predict which tweets are about a real disaster and which are not. The project topic is based around a Kaggle competition. 

In this project, you will have the chance to compare your prediction results with your fellows. Create an account for yourself in AIcrowd and join the competition.



🗄 Data
You can find the training data and the unlabeled test data in the Resources tab.

🚀 Submission
As you build your model and train it on the training data, you can generate predictions for the (unlabelled) test data. Make sure that your submission file has the same format as the example submission file on the Resources tab. Once you are sure about your model and satisfied with the prediction accuracy you got (on your own test data), you can try to generate predictions for the actual test data and submit in the competition.


In the readme.md you should a) mention the team name, b) describe the project c) your solution, and some results (using figures). d) include also a link to the video that showcases your solution.
